Simple overlay for whether your public IP is matched to a given IP address

I use a VPN most of the time, and turn it off for random reasons, and forget to turn it back on. 
I have always wanted a very basic overlay to tell me if I am on or off the VPN. 

I decided to throw one together. 

This is WPF, .NET 8, and very basic. 
Simply put in the IP of your Carrier that you want to use, and thats it. 
Top most will make it always on top.
If your IP match's the carrier IP, it will be red, else will be green. 

Checks IP changes every 10 seconds.
